NAME

    TeX::Encode - Encode/decode Perl utf-8 strings into TeX

SYNOPSIS

      use TeX::Encode;
      use Encode;
    
      $tex = encode('latex', "This will encode an e-acute (".chr(0xe9).") as \'e");
      $str = decode('latex', $tex); # Will decode the \'e too!

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides encoding to LaTeX escapes from utf8 using mapping
    tables in Pod::LaTeX and HTML::Entities. This covers only a subset of
    the Unicode character table (undef warnings will occur for non-mapped
    chars). This module is intentionally vague about what it will handle,
    see Caveats below.

    Mileage will vary when decoding (converting TeX to utf8), as TeX is in
    essence a programming language, and this module does not implement TeX.

    I use this module to encode author names in BibTeX and to do a rough
    job at presenting LaTeX abstracts in HTML. Using decode rather than
    seeing $\sqrt{\Omega^2\zeta_n}$ you get something that looks like the
    formula.

    The next logical step for this module is to integrate some level of TeX
    grammar to improve the decoding, in particular to handle fractions and
    font changes (which should probably be dropped).

METHODS

    TeX::Encode::encode STRING [, CHECK]

      Encodes a utf8 string into TeX. CHECK isn't implemented.

    TeX::Encode::decode STRING [, CHECK]

      Decodes a TeX string into utf8. CHECK isn't implemented.

    TeX::Encode::perlio_ok

      Returns 0. PerlIO isn't implemented.

CAVEATS

    Proper Encode checking is not implemented.

    LaTeX comments (% ...) are ignored because chopping a lot of text may
    not be what you actually want.

 encode()

    Converts non-ASCII Unicode characters to their equivalent TeX symbols
    (unTeXable characters will result in undef warnings).

 decode()

    Attempts to convert TeX symbols (e.g. \ae) to Unicode characters. As an
    experimental feature this also handles Math-mode TeX by inserting HTML
    into the resulting string (so you end up with an HTML approximation of
    the maths - NOT MathML).
